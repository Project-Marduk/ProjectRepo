# Project Marduk's repo

This repo is for our group's project for CS 3321, Introduction to Software Engineering, at Idaho State University.

## What does this Project do?
### Our Prompt 
Design and/or prototype a User Interface including the ability to:
- Construct both UI Wireframe and IFML Diagrams using a vector drawing approach
- Be capable of viewing and editing both types of diagrams
- Associate diagrams to a specific user and be able to save these into "folders" associated with the user
- Be extensible to later allow collaborative editing
- Be able to export diagrams to either PNG or SVG formats
- Each of these functions should be provided by both the Web and Desktop UIs

As we near the end of development, this will be updated to reflect our work.


## Why is this useful?

Having a conveinient place to conceptualize both the look and flow state of the User Interface will provide software engineers the tools to do so efficiently.

## How users can get started with the project?

At this point in time, the project is being developed. 

## Where users can get help with your project?

User's will have to wait to use this software. However, they may direct any questions to Traae at bloxtraa@isu.edu at this time.

## Who maintains and contributes to the project?
